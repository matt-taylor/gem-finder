# This config file will ensure Rails gem is up to date with the most recent release
# It uses the default rubygems.org ruby server to query versions against
# It has two behaviors
# Behavior 1:
# => Must be within the last 3 releases
# => When not within last 3 releases, it will log message and exit immediately
# Behavior 2:
# => Must be within the last 2 releases
# => When not within last 2 releases, it will log message and continue
# => Behavior is seen as a warning
#
# With multiple behaviors, order is important. If order was switched, if more than 3 releases behind,
# both messages would be shown to user instead of just one
# => Log Message via ERROR
# => Do nothing

# Config can support multiple gems!!
