# This config file will ensure rails_base gem is up to date based on SemVer specifics
# NOTE: Usage of git is a bit more expensive and will consume Github API get operations that are counted towards rate limit
# Major:
# Major version is set to 0. This will enforce that the gem is up to date with the latest major.
# If the current major version does not equal what is  released, failure behavior is triggered
#
# Patch:
# Given the current versions major.minor, the patch version is expected to be within the most 2 recent releases
# If not, it will trigger a failure
#
# Notice that minor is missing. This means it does not matter what minor version the current gem is on only that it is
# on the most recent major version and within 2 of the most recent patches released for the given minor version
#
# On Failure:
# Using log level Error, output the default message and then raise an error
